It is a comprehensive mathematical library

It has a file with all the major functionality, named as mathstein.py and is stored under folder named Mathstein.
The mathstein.py is further subcateogerized into sections, each implying the functionality added every week and is stored under the same folder, Mathstein
mathstein_week_1.py contains the functionality for a one variable solver and a multi variable solver.
mathstein_week_2.py contains the functionality for a quadratic solver, a cubic solver and a quatratic solver and also helps genetrating the graphs for the same.
mathstein_week_3.py contains the functionality for calculating area under a straight line and a curve and also gives a visual representation of how the area under a line or a curve would look.


The test cases for these files have been designed using the unittest module and are stored under folder named test_cases.
This folder contains test cases for all the files in Mathstein folder. 
Test cases have been designed for the main mathstein.py file and also for functionalities which were added on weekly basis.

The documentation for this entire project can be found under the folder named docs and has been documented using the Sphinx framework.
